# Overview

This is an assembly code equation parser that I built for my CSC 215 class. It takes in a file with multiple equations and evaluates them in bulk before appending the solutions to the input file. It supports parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, modulus, and shifting operations. It is built for the CP/M operating system on the 8080 microprocessor.
